      Measures markup completeness using counts of <meta>, schema.org, and Open Graph tags.
      Normalized on a 0-1 scale via observed tag counts divided by expected maxima.
  semantic:
    weight: 0.5
    description: |
      Scores semantic cohesion by chunking on-page text, generating OpenAI embeddings when
      available (falls back to deterministic local embeddings otherwise), and averaging pairwise
      cosine similarities. Higher values indicate consistent topical focus.
  authority:
    weight: 0.0
    description: |
      Placeholder for future backlink authority metric (not yet implemented in v0.1.0).
  freshness:
    weight: 0.0
    description: |
      Placeholder for planned content freshness metric (pending crawler enhancements).
